# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

This project represent part of **Software Engineering Course** at **ALX**.
It presents projects on implemention of **if, if-else** and **while loops**.

## Learning Objectives

* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
* What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
* What the the relational operators and how to use them
* What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
* What are the boolean operators and how to use them
* How to use the if, if ... else statements
* How to use comments
* How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
* How to assign values to variables
* How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
* How to use the while loop
* How to use variables with the while loop
* How to print variables using printf
* What is the ASCII character set
* What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64 

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
* There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
* You are not allowed to use `system`
* Your code should use the `Betty style`. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`


## Project Tasks

|Task|Description|
|-------|---------|
|`0-positive_or_negative.c`| This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.|
|`1-last_digit.c`|Assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n|
|`2-print_alphabet.c`|Prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.|
|`3-print_alphabets.c`|rints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line|
|`4-print_alphabt.c`|prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line; Print all the letters except q and e
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar twice in your code|
